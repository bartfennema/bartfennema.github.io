## Email

I can be contacted via email using the following addresses:

* `bartf1969@protonmail.com` for private and secure matters
* `bfennema@gmail.com` for private matters (but hey no standard encryption
* `bartf1969@gmail.com`


### Note on confidentiality

Please note that, as most other people and organizations, I use a 3rd party Mail
Service Provider. The staff who work at the provider are technically able to
read all my incoming and outgoing mail. This is by definition of how email
infrastructure work, and it is irrelevant whether SSL or other encryption is
used between email clients and corresponding email servers. If you have
something confidential, please use PGP/GPG encryption to secure our
communication (see [keys.md](/keys/) for info how to obtain and verify my GPG
keys).

### Note on integrity of my emails

All email sent by me from the above-mentioned email addresses should be
digitally signed with my email [keys](/keys/).

### Other notes on emailing me

* I strongly prefer plaintext emails. If you send me an HTML-formatted message I
will still be viewing it as plaintext, and so I might be missing on some of the
extra information you put there, such as markings done with differently colored
fonts, etc.
