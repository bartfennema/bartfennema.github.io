          For a long time I had the urge to craft a web blog that was super simple and could be managed from my Emacs editor. </br>
	  For quite some time I've been following <a href="https://merveilles.town/web/@tickfoot" target="_blank">Tickfoot on Mastodon</a>.
	  <a href="https://tickfoot.sensorstation.co/index.html" target="_blank">Her website</a> is full of interesting articles about gardening, homesteading and permaculture, but simplicity incarnate! She generously allowed my use of her format and now here we are.

	  Some more write-up is needed, but I can tell you in advance that it is about Nikola Tesla's tower. He built it whil experimenting with electrical current that he was trying to distribute wirelessly. His vision was free electricity all across the globe.
	  He was far ahead of his time and his story is both inspiring and brilliant as well as sad for being put down by the greed of commercial 'partners'.
