	    <summary>This post may not be for the sensitive of heart. You have been warned.</summary>
	    So without further ado, I masturbate. There, i'm just like any other person, at least I think.</br>
	    Do women masturbate? Why not. Doesn't everybody? It doesn't really make any difference, things are what they are.</br>
	    Oh wait there's another one: I watch porn. Not truckloads and for me it stops with consenting adults. There should be some joy in it.</br>
	    For example I don't get joy from watching BDSM, rape-like sex, or many other categories that are out there. So I just don't watch that.</br>
	    ..however..</br>
	    A couple of years ago, I started to notice that I just did not get so aroused by the pornhub porn anymore. Maybe I've seen too much and my senses have been dulled?</br>
	    What a horrible notion! What does watching porn actually do with you?</br>
	    Usually I did not think much of it.</br>
	    But getting disinterested in sex did not seem like a good sign to me. So why not just quit watching porn?</br>
	    ..</br>
	    Well, I can tell you that it was not that simple. Both masturbation and watching porn had become a habit. And let's be real, a habit I've been doing since puberty.</br>
	    And thank god I've gotten rid of maybe 90% of the shame that I had about that.</br>
	    So how to go about this. Just using force to not masturbate or watch porn, as I've learned from dealing with other habits, is prone to failure.</br>
	    But maybe I can hold on forcefully for just long enough to gain a fresher perspective on what I'm doing.</br>
	    As I was struggeling with how to deal with this, it became oktober 31st. </br></br>So the day after that would not just be november 1st, but for a large reddit community it would be the start of No Nut November.</br>
	    It is a sort of month long challenge. For one month you do not have an orgasm. That's it. Some take it up a notch and forbid watching porn, but the one and only real rule is, don't cum.</br>
	    So, it is okay to touch yourself, feel pleasure about it, but no man should ejaculate.</br>
	    I have not ever read anything about women participating, even though there is no rule against it. Just no orgasms for one month.</br>
            I decided to join this challenge, even though I kept quiet about it. Where I live you don't just openly talk about masturbation.</br>
	    Also I decided to not watch porn or even any form of nudity.</br>
	    As I'm writing this, I've finished the challenge. It has just become december 1st.</br>
            </br>
	    So what have I learned or experienced?</br>
	    That is actually difficult to describe. My balls did not turn blue, my dick did not fall off, I did not become impotent nor did I become grumpy or unable to have a decent conversation with women.</br>
	    Every once in a while some thought or encounter caused the flame of desire to raise its head (no pun intended).</br>
	    And that was actually THE most interesting challenge! To experience both the rise and fall of desire, or lust, in a more conscious way than in a loooong time.</br>
	    It brought me closer in touch with my own sexuality. I got to experience actually how often this happened. Wait, I'm horny again!?</br>
	    So yeah, that was eh, confronting :-)</br>
	    But there's some feelings involved that are subtler than just being horny. It seemed there's a whole world of feelings that was waiting for me to discover it...</br>
	    </br>
	    Well, december 1st has come. Actually I still haven't, haha, pun intended.</br>
	    But seriously, let's just see what happens. For now I'll keep my porn blockers in place as I've lost interest in the brand of sex that pornhub sells.

	  <details>
	    <summary>And suddenly we had a visit from 4 chickens in our garden!</summary>
	    Now at our allotment garden keeping chickens is FORBIDDEN.
	    The thing is, they are not our chickens, we aren't keeping them. They are just visiting, albeit regularly haha.
	    So we made sure they had a safe space, a shelter, a bit of food.
	    One day two of those rolling stones decided to move on. So, now there are two chickens left.
	    They seem to be happy, getting food from both us and our neighbours. Probably from other gardners as well. They look healthy.
	    We'll just see how it goes.

	  <h3 class="topicBlock__header">Sustainability</h3>
	  <details>
	    <summary>We all know there's a climate-problem.</summary>
	    Climate change is a kind of problem whereby everyone knows it is there but can safely say that it is mostly caused by others, not so much be our individual selves really.</br>
	    'So it's okay if I....[fill in what you want that is environmentally unfriendly]'</br>
	    We've gradually grown aware that we need to do something before it is too late.</br>
	    So we recycle our garbage, isolate our houses, use a warmth pump installation and throw out our energy inefficient boilers.</br>
	    We buy electric bikes and cars (average $54000), because that is much more sustainable than burning fuel right?</br></br>
	    ...i'm having a harder time believing that. I do not think we are on the right path to do something against climate change, and maybe we are framing the problem wrong.</br>
	    I mean, even though we recycle our plastic, we as a people produce <a href="img/plastic.png">more plastic then ever before</a>, and more each year.</br>
	    We throw away our regular bikes an buy very expensive e-bikes (average $2000), that need to be produced. The batteries that are produced require <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/01/chart-countries-produce-lithium-world/" target="_blank">lithium that is being mined all around the world</a>, and more each year.</br>
	    The production of e-bikes increases, and more each year. The global population grows, and more each year. The <a href="https://www.overshootday.org/" target="_blank">Earth Overshoot day</a> is arriving earlier, and more so each year.</br>
	    We buy more solar panels, and more each year. Recycling seems sustainable, using solar power instead of coal seems sustainable, driving electric instead of on fossil fuel seems sustainable.</br>
	    See a pattern already?</br>
	    We shouldn't recyle plastic just so there can be more demand for plastic. We shouldn't use electric cars just so there can be more cars and more roads etc.</br>
	    I think that what we are doing is not sustainable. We really forget to tend to our home, earth. There is no limit to our growth, our expansion, so we keep on consuming.</br>
	    We should not aim to be more efficient. We don't really need more...cows, ikea's, televisions, cars, stuff really.</br>
	    I think we should learn to limit ourselves. Do we really need a bigger house? More money? More holidays? More shoes?</br>
	    If we try to limit ourselves, buy less, reproduce less, grow less, expand less, consume less, tiktok less probably...maybe we would reduce humanities global footprint.</br>
	    Maybe we would start to take care of our surroundings, live more in harmony with our environment, create communities to provide for eachother.</br>
	    Maybe we would become happy again with what we have, with where we are, with who we are.</br>
	    As Jim Carey said: Maybe this is not something you hear celebreties say often but, I've done enough, I have enough, I am enough.</br>
	    ..So am I a hypocrite? Probably. I'm not really sure humanity can turn this around. We are what we are after all.</br>
	    Can I then just live with a bit of acceptance and compassion? Maybe a bit of joy?</br>
	    I hope I can, I feel rather stoic about what I see around me...</br>
	    Re-reading what I've just written, I could have just written: Save the planet, use less, expand less, be happy.

	  <h3 class="topicBlock__header">Restarted meditation practice again</h3>
	  <details>
	    <summary>For quite some time I've been very interested in Zen and Buddhism.</summary>	  	    
	    I've been meditating for years, sometimes every day for 3 months, sometimes once every month.
	    Sometimes for 5 minutes, sometimes for an hour.
	    There was a period where I felt that my meditation really confronted me with my own emptyness and that scared me. It felt like after a couple of minutes things would go 'dark' and silent and that I would forget to breathe....
	    It's difficult to describe something like it. But it made me feel uncomfortable and I stopped meditating. (Did Ashtanga yoga for a couple of years in the meantime)
	    ...still, I missed doing it. So a while ago, on some social media there was a link to this buddhist blog with an article about meditating. About it being a way to wake up.
	    Now that is a direction I can live with! Just being here, being present with my breath.

	  <p class="p--noted">This is what happens every time!</p>
	  <details>
	    <summary>The pro's I want...</summary>
	    A small OS.</br>
	    Small resource usage, i.e. it should run fast on my machine.</br>
	    Open source.</br>
	    I can do everything I 'normally' do on my Mac or PC.</br>
	  </details>
	  <details>
	    <summary>The con's I get...</summary>
	    Oh, it will be powerful, it will be leaaan and mean! The source? It is open AF. (Maybe not certain drivers for wifi, but will I lose sleep over that?...</br>
	    Whenever something does NOT work like I expected, it requires huge amounts of configuration.</br>
	    Let's read up on expert forums:</br>
	    It is almost never a matter of checking a certain box or turning a switch on or off.</br>
	    It is almost always a matter of recompiling some kernel module, building a library but first finding out about never before seen prerequisites and installing/making them first.</br>
	    Enable multilib repo first ofc....</br>
	    Oh yeah, but you can't use this with Python 6, you have to use Python 7 because there was a dependency on libluzdgfugf.so which had the access rights set wrong.</br>
	    I just wanna play Spotify....I just wanna watch Netflix.</br>
	    Wait, I can! (Reboot into Mac again)
	  </details>
	  <details>
	    <summary>My contemplation on this all...</summary>
	    Maybe Linux is not suited for someone like me. I feel like I'm intelligent enough, but I get really annoyed when I read the amount of nerdspeak on forums.
	    Do I really need to know all this? Why is it never simple? Emacs, to me, at least is simple enough. As long as I just use vanilla emacs. It took me long enough to become reasonnably fluent in using it.
	    However, most people that write about emacs create lisp functions to get a certain result. And on the same forum someone creates the mother of all lisp functions that help you write lisp functions....or whatever. I just don't want to spend so much time in it. I just wanna use org-mode (I think) and that's it.</br>
	    It feels like it's time to close down my computer and go outside for a walk, or have a conversation with my wife or daughter.

	    <summary>Efficiency</summary>
	    I have vacation for 3 weeks and I notice that my brain is quite fried...hmm [pondering]..maybe something to be aware of...But that is something for another post.</br>
	    Since I just finished a book, I updated my <a href="now.html">NOW page</a>.
	    Reading is something I love, even though sometimes there just doesn't seem to be enough rest in my body to just sit and read..</br>
	    Because I love books, I update my books on a website called Storygraph, where you can see what I've read, when, how many pages, the genre...stuff like that.
	    Now i _could_ just link to my Storygraph profile and not update what I read on my own site...but...No!</br>
	    Even though it may be efficient, there is value in handcrafting what I would like to share with you, the reader. I think that this may actually be the driving force of this website, awareness through handcrafting. I feel that being efficient would ... hinder that development.</br>
	    Well, that's it for now. Oh no wait, one more thing to share!</br></br>

	    <summary>QiGong practice</summary>
	    For about 7 years I've practiced Ashtanga yoga. As I grew older the price I had to pay for not paying attention to my limits, being impatient or even competitive (sigh, it is true), was that my injuries took longer and longer to heal. I've hurt my shoulder, back and knees many times, because 'I used to be able to do this easily', or whatever hurried thinking I had.</br>
	    Then I got pneumonia twice in a year. My fitness and strength had left the building and I had a bad time even doing 5 sun salutations.</br>
	    Of course, once I was recovered enough from the pneumonia, I took up practice again and in no time injured my knee and my back. Time to be still and start to listen, i guess.</br>
	    What is important for me is being in contact with my body and my breath. Letting my awareness come along with my movements. Speed or strength really are no matter for me.</br>
	    Oh it would be nice to be able to handstand, or do jump throughs or whatnot....but that would be all ego on my part. 'Look at me, at what I can doooo'...
	    I stumbled upon Qigong accidentally and found a Qigong practice that I actually like to do every day without it feeling as a workout.
	    (Here's a link to what I do each day: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMTI5R6V9g">Eight Pieces of Brocade</a>.)</br>
	    I'm happy to be able to move each day, in a safe way as well, feeling refreshed or awake afterwards!

	  <p class="p--noted">We had a lovely time!</p>
  	  <details>
	    <summary>No spoilers..</summary>
	    Since our daughter is visiting Dusseldorf with her boyfriend, my wife and I treated ourselves to movie and a dinner. It has been a while.</br>
	    Where we live we can choose a theater with, so to speak, mainstream movies, and a theater that shows...well, good movies! haha, no seriously, films that are generally more
	    artful, less blockbuster, less about violence or revenge...I am really not sure how to describe the difference in genre, actually!</br></br>
	    [Flashback]</br>
	    This theater always brings me back to now 4 years ago, when I left my previous company. It was a very stressful and for me unsafe time, emotionally. Time for me to leave! On
	    the last day that seemed to last forever amidst demons and torture (okay, a bit dramatic), my wife picked me up from work. She travelled to a different city to pick me up.<3
            There she was, waiting outside, the sun shining on her beautiful being. It was like landing in a safe harbour, no longer under pressure from whomever at my old company. None of that mattered anymore.
	    We went together by train to our home town to visit this theater to see this movie, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB8PpdeSXRQ">the Ramen Shop</a>.
            </br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB8PpdeSXRQ"><img src="img/ramenshop.png" class="imgBlock" alt="scene from the movie The Ramen Shop"></a>
            </br> It was a peaceful, warm, soft, kind movie. Just what I needed to start thawing. It would take a long time to feel myself and confident again, but seeing that movie with my wife was the start.</br>
            </br>However....that was not the movie we saw today!</br>
	    This time, on our date night, we went to see <a href="https://oenek.substack.com/p/mon-crime-the-crime-is-mine-francois">Mon Crime</a>, the link referring to a better review than I could write.
What a thoroughly enjoyable movie it was! We had a blast.</br>
We concluded our evening at a restaurant we've been visiting for more than 20 years. An evening well spent.

	  <h3 class="topicBlock__header">About Mieterseboel</h3>
	  <details>
	  <summary>What I write on this blog and where does the name come from?</summary>
          I’m not that much of a writer. There originates not much in me that has not already been written</br>
	  about a thousand times on the net. And that is okay.</br>
	  Instead I collect stories and images that are interesting to me. Because they resonate with ‘where I am, now’. And I like to share with the world out there what I see and ponder about 🙂</br>
	  </br>
	  So you might notice this blog is all over the place, as am I. It is maybe different now from then, as am I. And who knows, maybe I will discover some purpose along the way.</br>
	  </br>
	  By the way, ‘Mieterse boel’ is a Dutch way of saying ‘the whole shebang’, although apparently</br>
	  I’m one of the few remaining peeps to say or remember that. </br>
	  Once in a diner, that I visited with my wife and daughter, after looking at all the options of a breakfast menu, I ordered the ‘hele mieterse boel’, meaning:</br>
	  the coffee, cheese, croissant, orange juice, bacon, eggs, a banana… well you know, the whole shebang!</br>
	  </br>
	  The waiter nodded, and it was not until after I saw my wife and daughter with a red head from holding in their laughter that I suspected there was something funny going on.</br>
	  When the waiter was gone they yelled: “Mieterse boel??? Really!!??!? What does that even mean!?!”</br>
	  Well it’s perfectly normal and common Dutch expression, thank you very much!</br>
	  </br>
	  Hence, ergo, thus, so it came to pass…

	  Some more write-up is needed, but I can tell you in advance that it is about Nikola Tesla's tower. He built it while experimenting with electrical current that he was trying to distribute wirelessly. His vision was to provide free electricity all across the globe.
	  He was far ahead of his time and his story is both inspiring and brilliant as well as sad for being put down by the greed of commercial 'partners'.

          For a long time I had the urge to craft a web blog that was super simple and could be managed from my Emacs editor. </br>

	  <a href="https://tickfoot.sensorstation.co/index.html" target="_blank">Her website</a> is full of interesting articles about gardening, homesteading and permaculture, but simplicity incarnate! She generously allowed my use of her format and now here we are.
