          I‚Äôm not that much of a writer. There originates not much in me that has not already been written</br>
	  about a thousand times on the net. And that is okay.</br>
	  Instead I collect stories and images that are interesting to me. Because they resonate with ‚Äòwhere I am, now‚Äô. And I like to share with the world out there what I see and ponder about üôÇ</br>
	  </br>
	  So you might notice this blog is all over the place, as am I. It is maybe different now from then, as am I. And who knows, maybe I will discover some purpose along the way.</br>
	  </br>
	  By the way, ‚ÄòMieterse boel‚Äô is a Dutch way of saying ‚Äòthe whole shebang‚Äô, although apparently</br>
	  I‚Äôm one of the few remaining peeps to say or remember that. </br>
	  Once in a diner, that I visited with my wife and daughter, after looking at all the options of a breakfast menu, I ordered the ‚Äòhele mieterse boel‚Äô, meaning:</br>
	  the coffee, cheese, croissant, orange juice, bacon, eggs, a banana‚Ä¶ well you know, the whole shebang!</br>
	  </br>
	  The waiter nodded, and it was not until after I saw my wife and daughter with a red head from holding in their laughter that I suspected there was something funny going on.</br>
	  When the waiter was gone they yelled: ‚ÄúMieterse boel??? Really!!??!? What does that even mean!?!‚Äù</br>
	  Well it‚Äôs perfectly normal and common Dutch expression, thank you very much!</br>
	  </br>
	  Hence, ergo, thus, so it came to pass‚Ä¶

	  Some more write-up is needed, but I can tell you in advance that it is about Nikola Tesla's tower. He built it while experimenting with electrical current that he was trying to distribute wirelessly. His vision was to provide free electricity all across the globe.
	  He was far ahead of his time and his story is both inspiring and brilliant as well as sad for being put down by the greed of commercial 'partners'.

          For a long time I had the urge to craft a web blog that was super simple and could be managed from my Emacs editor. </br>
	  For quite some time I've been following <a href="https://merveilles.town/web/@tickfoot" target="_blank">Tickfoot on Mastodon</a>.
	  <a href="https://tickfoot.sensorstation.co/index.html" target="_blank">Her website</a> is full of interesting articles about gardening, homesteading and permaculture, but simplicity incarnate! She generously allowed my use of her format and now here we are.
