	    <summary>The pro's I want...</summary>
	    A small OS.</br>
	    Small resource usage, i.e. it should run fast on my machine.</br>
	    Open source.</br>
	    I can do everything I 'normally' do on my Mac or PC.</br>
	  </details>
	  <details>
	    <summary>The con's I get...</summary>
	    Oh, it will be powerful, it will be leaaan and mean! The source? It is open AF. (Maybe not certain drivers for wifi, but will I lose sleep over that?...</br>
	    Whenever something does NOT work like I expected, it requires huge amounts of configuration.</br>
	    Let's read up on expert forums:</br>
	    It is almost never a matter of checking a certain box or turning a switch on or off.</br>
	    It is almost always a matter of recompiling some kernel module, building a library but first finding out about never before seen prerequisites and installing/making them first.</br>
	    Enable multilib repo first ofc....</br>
	    Oh yeah, but you can't use this with Python 6, you have to use Python 7 because there was a dependency on libluzdgfugf.so which had the access rights set wrong.</br>
	    I just wanna play Spotify....I just wanna watch Netflix.</br>
	    Wait, I can! (Reboot into Mac again)

	    <summary>My contemplation on this all...</summary>
	    Maybe Linux is not suited for someone like me. I feel like I'm intelligent enough, but I get really annoyed when I read the amount of nerdspeak on forums.
	    Do I really need to know all this? Why is it never simple? Emacs, to me, at least is simple enough. As long as I just use vanilla emacs. It took me long enough to become reasonnably fluent in using it.
	    However, most people that write about emacs create lisp functions to get a certain result. And on the same forum someone creates the mother of all lisp functions that help you write lisp functions....or whatever. I just don't want to spend so much time in it. I just wanna use org-mode (I think) and that's it.</br>
	    It feels like it's time to close down my computer and go outside for a walk, or have a conversation with my wife or daughter.

	    <summary>Efficiency</summary>
	    I have vacation for 3 weeks and I notice that my brain is quite fried...hmm [pondering]..maybe something to be aware of...But that is something for another post.</br>
	    Since I just finished a book, I updated my <a href="now.html">NOW page</a>.
	    Reading is something I love, even though sometimes there just doesn't seem to be enough rest in my body to just sit and read..</br>
	    Because I love books, I update my books on a website called Storygraph, where you can see what I've read, when, how many pages, the genre...stuff like that.
	    Now i _could_ just link to my Storygraph profile and not update what I read on my own site...but...No!</br>
	    Even though it may be efficient, there is value in handcrafting what I would like to share with you, the reader. I think that this may actually be the driving force of this website, awareness through handcrafting. I feel that being efficient would ... hinder that development.</br>
	    Well, that's it for now. Oh no wait, one more thing to share!</br></br>

	    <summary>QiGong practice</summary>
	    For about 7 years I've practiced Ashtanga yoga. As I grew older the price I had to pay for not paying attention to my limits, being impatient or even competitive (sigh, it is true), was that my injuries took longer and longer to heal. I've hurt my shoulder, back and knees many times, because 'I used to be able to do this easily', or whatever hurried thinking I had.</br>
	    Then I got pneumonia twice in a year. My fitness and strength had left the building and I had a bad time even doing 5 sun salutations.</br>
	    Of course, once I was recovered enough from the pneumonia, I took up practice again and in no time injured my knee and my back. Time to be still and start to listen, i guess.</br>
	    What is important for me is being in contact with my body and my breath. Letting my awareness come along with my movements. Speed or strength really are no matter for me.</br>
	    Oh it would be nice to be able to handstand, or do jump throughs or whatnot....but that would be all ego on my part. 'Look at me, at what I can doooo'...
	    I stumbled upon Qigong accidentally and found a Qigong practice that I actually like to do every day without it feeling as a workout.
	    (Here's a link to what I do each day: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMTI5R6V9g">Eight Pieces of Brocade</a>.)</br>
	    I'm happy to be able to move each day, in a safe way as well, feeling refreshed or awake afterwards!

	  <p class="p--noted">We had a lovely time!</p>
  	  <details>
	    <summary>No spoilers..</summary>
	    Since our daughter is visiting Dusseldorf with her boyfriend, my wife and I treated ourselves to movie and a dinner. It has been a while.</br>
	    Where we live we can choose a theater with, so to speak, mainstream movies, and a theater that shows...well, good movies! haha, no seriously, films that are generally more
	    artful, less blockbuster, less about violence or revenge...I am really not sure how to describe the difference in genre, actually!</br></br>
	    [Flashback]</br>
	    This theater always brings me back to now 4 years ago, when I left my previous company. It was a very stressful and for me unsafe time, emotionally. Time for me to leave! On
	    the last day that seemed to last forever amidst demons and torture (okay, a bit dramatic), my wife picked me up from work. She travelled to a different city to pick me up.<3
            There she was, waiting outside, the sun shining on her beautiful being. It was like landing in a safe harbour, no longer under pressure from whomever at my old company. None of that mattered anymore.
	    We went together by train to our home town to visit this theater to see this movie, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB8PpdeSXRQ">the Ramen Shop</a>.
            </br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB8PpdeSXRQ"><img src="img/ramenshop.png" class="imgBlock" alt="scene from the movie The Ramen Shop"></a>
            </br> It was a peaceful, warm, soft, kind movie. Just what I needed to start thawing. It would take a long time to feel myself and confident again, but seeing that movie with my wife was the start.</br>
            </br>However....that was not the movie we saw today!</br>
	    This time, on our date night, we went to see <a href="https://oenek.substack.com/p/mon-crime-the-crime-is-mine-francois">Mon Crime</a>, the link referring to a better review than I could write.
What a thoroughly enjoyable movie it was! We had a blast.</br>
We concluded our evening at a restaurant we've been visiting for more than 20 years. An evening well spent.

	  <h3 class="topicBlock__header">About Mieterseboel</h3>
	  <p class="p--noted">What I write on this blog and where does the name come from?</p>
	  <details>
	  <summary>More</summary>
          I‚Äôm not that much of a writer. There originates not much in me that has not already been written</br>
	  about a thousand times on the net. And that is okay.</br>
	  Instead I collect stories and images that are interesting to me. Because they resonate with ‚Äòwhere I am, now‚Äô. And I like to share with the world out there what I see and ponder about üôÇ</br>
	  </br>
	  So you might notice this blog is all over the place, as am I. It is maybe different now from then, as am I. And who knows, maybe I will discover some purpose along the way.</br>
	  </br>
	  By the way, ‚ÄòMieterse boel‚Äô is a Dutch way of saying ‚Äòthe whole shebang‚Äô, although apparently</br>
	  I‚Äôm one of the few remaining peeps to say or remember that. </br>
	  Once in a diner, that I visited with my wife and daughter, after looking at all the options of a breakfast menu, I ordered the ‚Äòhele mieterse boel‚Äô, meaning:</br>
	  the coffee, cheese, croissant, orange juice, bacon, eggs, a banana‚Ä¶ well you know, the whole shebang!</br>
	  </br>
	  The waiter nodded, and it was not until after I saw my wife and daughter with a red head from holding in their laughter that I suspected there was something funny going on.</br>
	  When the waiter was gone they yelled: ‚ÄúMieterse boel??? Really!!??!? What does that even mean!?!‚Äù</br>
	  Well it‚Äôs perfectly normal and common Dutch expression, thank you very much!</br>
	  </br>
	  Hence, ergo, thus, so it came to pass‚Ä¶

	  <summary>More</summary>
	  Some more write-up is needed, but I can tell you in advance that it is about Nikola Tesla's tower. He built it while experimenting with electrical current that he was trying to distribute wirelessly. His vision was to provide free electricity all across the globe.
	  He was far ahead of his time and his story is both inspiring and brilliant as well as sad for being put down by the greed of commercial 'partners'.

	  <summary>More</summary>
          For a long time I had the urge to craft a web blog that was super simple and could be managed from my Emacs editor. </br>
	  For quite some time I've been following <a href="https://merveilles.town/web/@tickfoot" target="_blank">Tickfoot on Mastodon</a>.
	  <a href="https://tickfoot.sensorstation.co/index.html" target="_blank">Her website</a> is full of interesting articles about gardening, homesteading and permaculture, but simplicity incarnate! She generously allowed my use of her format and now here we are.
