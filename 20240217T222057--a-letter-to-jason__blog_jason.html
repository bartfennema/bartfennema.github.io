Subject: Big thanks
Hi Jason,
</p>

<p>
just wanted to let you know, I read your blogs on <a href="https://janusworx.com/blog/note-to-self-less-research-less-rabbit-holes/">less research, less rabbitholes</a> and your <a href="https://janusworx.com/antifragile/">notes on Antifragility</a>.
Interestingly they ALL resonated with me. I liked your writingstyle because it resembles part of my own thoughts.
I so recognize what procrastination can do. My curiosity takes me all over the place and all focus is gone, more often than not.
Recently I've taken up writing with pen and paper, one page each morning. No purpose, no good or bad writing, it doesnt need to be anything. Just write whatever is in my mind.
It is lovely what I discover along the way.
</p>

<p>
Meditation: I've done it for some years but have lost the habit. I find it difficult to pick up again, even though I've experienced the benefits.
</p>

<p>
As for antifragility. I can recognize your points, even though I feel that they represent an illusion for me. I mean, I've been interested in zen buddhism for a long time, and my view on it is that by just being in the here and now, being present, breathing in and out, there is no randomness because there is no regularity. Things cannot go wrong, because there is nothing I can do, so I don't need strength. No unexpected things happen, since nothing can be predicted. All I can do is be present here and now, breathe in, breathe out.
Not sure if it makes sense, but as for skin in the game, these things are what I've been struggling with for quite some years :-)
</p>

<p>
Wrapping up: thank you for sharing your posts, your feed is in my elfeed.org.
Wishing you all the best.
regards,
Bart
